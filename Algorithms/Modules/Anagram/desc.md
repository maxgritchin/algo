1. **Character Frequency Comparison:** The most common approach is to compare the frequency of each character in both strings. By comparing the counts of each character, we can determine if the strings are anagrams. This pattern involves using a data structure like a dictionary or a hash map to store the frequency of characters.
2. **Sorting:** Another approach is to sort both strings and check if the sorted versions are equal. Anagrams have the same characters, so sorting the strings should result in identical sequences of characters. This pattern involves using sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.
3. **Character Counting:** Instead of comparing the frequency of each character, we can also use an array or a fixed-size integer counter to keep track of the count of each character. This approach is feasible when the input contains a limited character set, such as lowercase English letters. The index of the array represents the character, and the value represents its count.
4. **Character Encoding:** If the strings only consist of lowercase English letters, we can use an integer variable as a bit mask to encode the presence or absence of each character. This pattern uses bitwise operations to set or unset specific bits corresponding to the characters in the string.
