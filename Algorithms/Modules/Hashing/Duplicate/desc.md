The method uses a HashSet<int> named set to keep track of the unique values encountered so far. It iterates through each element in the nums array. If the set already contains the current element, it means the element is a duplicate, and the method returns true. Otherwise, it adds the element to the set. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the method returns false.
